Bug: Rest API

Bug Title : The system shouldn't allow user to create a dataset with a wrong key


Steps to reproduce:
Use post route to create a dataset 
Enter wrong key i.e. "name123" instead of "name"
Hit the API request 

Expected: The system should return an error message 

Actual: The system is accepting request payload with invalid key
